# Simple_Blackjack_Game_with_Python
This is a simple Blackjack card game with Python. It allows only 2 players with the computer as the dealer. The rules are simple:

1. You deal 2 cards, the dealer also deals 2 cards
2. Any sum of the points from both cards from you and the dealer is closer to 21 is the winning point.
3. If the sum of your point or the dealer's point is 21, that person wins immediately.
4. From #3., if any point is over 21, that person looses immediately.
5. If the point is lower than 21, you can ask for more cards (called 'hit').
6. If the dealer's point is innitially lower than 17, he must draw a card.
7. Any card from 2 - 10 has its 'face value' points.
8. Jack, Queen, King, each counts as 10 points.
9. Ace counts as 1 or 11, depending on the total points.

This set of Python code feature the use of randomization with weightde probability, loop, if-else conditioning, list, and function. Although it's only a 2-player simple card game, the code is quite long and may not be most stream-lined. However, the code works fine. It also gives you a summary of how many games you've played and how many times you've won or lost, in a grammartically correct way.
